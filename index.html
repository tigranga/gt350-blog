                    <h2>What's this site?</h2>
                    <p>Let me first share a bit of context. 
                        After owning a 2010 GT500 for two years I really fell in love with the mustang on steroids.
                        Being hooked on the power, I has reluctant to go with a new Mustang with less ponies under the hood, 
                        despite GT350s that just came out were much better cars in many different ways.
                        After test driving one I could feel how the car was underpowered 
                        (though very capable and just another level compared to the 2010 GT500 I owned).
                        So I started watching for the new GT500.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Jan 14th 2019 Ford announced (among other things) that the new GT500 would be automatic, 
                        which was really a dealbreaker for me.
                        That didn't really leave me much of a choice other than going with a boosted GT350.
                        In summer of 2019 I purchased Ruby and the journey began.

                        This site is sharing more about that journey for community's good.

                    <h2>The search</h2>
                    <p>It turned out that even after 4 years being in production, it was hard to get a GT350 without a markup!
                        Every dealeship I called had at least $10K markup, which made me open the map and go further and explore dealership in other states. One other things I was looking in parallel is whether to supercharge or turbocharge the car and what quality shops were out there who could give me the beast I was looking to drive. Digging the internet for boosted cars I frequently came across the cars Hennessey Performance was making and coincidently, the dealership just two miles away from them offered custom ordering for me at MSRP!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the order was made, I started digging more about Henessey Performance and oh boy, all sorts of stuff came up.
                        I realized it all had to be taken with grain of salt, and that it was anekdotal, but the sheer amount of posts people sharing their sad stories from the past got me thinking if I wanted to take the risk.
                        The last nail in the coffin was my conversation about this topic with the dealership when the salesman I was working with told me although they were just two miles away from the shop, they never sent any of their customers to Hennessey. Wow, ok. Hmm.
