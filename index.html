                    <p>
                        Let me first share a bit of back story first. 
                        After owning a 2010 GT500 for two years I really fell in love with the concept of the mustang on steroids.
                        Becoming hooked on the power, I has reluctant to go with a new Mustang with less ponies under the hood 
                        when the time came to get the new model, despite GT350s that just came out were much better cars in many 
                        different ways. After test driving one I could feel how the car was underpowered but at the same time 
                        very capable and just another level compared to the 2010 GT500 I owned. 
                        So I started waiting for the new GT500 to come out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally on Jan 14th 2019 Ford unveiled it and, to my disappointment, the new GT500 turned out to be 
                        automatic. It was a dealbreaker for me. That didn't really leave me much of a choice other than going 
                        with a boosted GT350. In summer of 2019 I purchased Ruby and the journey began.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This site is sharing more about that journey and hopefully it can help someone in their search or 
                        making similar decisions.

                    <p>
                        It turned out that even after 4 years being in production, it was still hard to get a GT350 
                        without a markup! Every dealeship I called had at least $10K markup, which made me open the map 
                        and go further and explore the dealerships in other states. 
                        One other things I was looking in parallel is whether to supercharge or turbocharge the car 
                        and what quality shops were out there who could give me the beast I was looking to drive. 
                        Digging the internet for boosted cars I frequently came across the cars Hennessey Performance 
                        was making and coincidently, the dealership just a few smiles away from them offered custom ordering 
                        for me at MSRP!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the order was made, I started digging more about Henessey Performance 
                        and oh boy, all sorts of stuff came up.
                        I realized it all had to be taken with a grain of salt, and that it was anekdotal, 
                        but the sheer amount of posts people sharing their sad stories 
                        got me thinking if I wanted to take the risk.
                        The last nail in the coffin was my conversation about this topic with the dealership 
                        when the salesman I was working with told me although they were just a few miles away from the shop, 
                        they never sent any of their customers to Hennessey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wow, ok. Hmm. The search continued now with the car being delivered to the dealership in Texas, 
                        with me being in WA and uncertainty around how I was going to boost it. It didn't take too much longer 
                        though. Pretty soon I got to watch a bunch of religious videos with folks comparing turbos and 
                        supercharges, which led me to learn more about the technical differences and what it would mean to me 
                        as an owner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At some point I came across a video of a twin turbo GT350 built by FathouseFab and exploring more 
                        I found out the cars they were building were not just garage built "one-time fun" ponies, 
                        but something they put an effort to be a finished product. One of the videos I watched was about the 
                        advanced engine management system they were using 
                        (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0luihbbMg4" target="_blank">MoTeC</a>). 
                        At that time the idea of spending $14K 
                        on an engine management system sounded rediculous to me, and I nenver thought I would ever consider 
                        spending money on something like that, but more on that later. Watching further their other vides like 
                        the review of the MoTeC M150 system it became more clear that the guys not only loved what they were 
                        doing but knew that shit really well. So I called them up and felt really good about that discussion 
                        and decided to go with them. All the decisions were made which was a relief.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Apart from the above, a couple more factors playing into why I eventually went with this turbo option:
                        <ul>
                            <li>More efficient way of building power.</li>
                            <li>In this case, a platform that I could use to bootst the car even more, with non-invasive, 
                                additive changes.
                            </li>
                            <li>I knew how supercharged car was like and wanted to experience a turbocharged one 
                                (and I didn't regret).
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Did I mention FathouseFab is based in Indianapolis area? 
                            Flying from WA to TX to pick up my car, driving it 1,000 miles to IN to leave it with a person 
                            who I never met before and flying back to WA the same day was not something I would typically do, 
                            but it happened.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I guess, it's normal for car people to do these things so let's go with that. 
                            Afterall, it turned out to be an awesome trip with my son who got to stall a GT350 in the middle 
                            of the road surrounded by farms in Tennessee.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Driving the car for a 8hr/day was quiet an experience. I didn't feel tired though and 
                            I just couldn't stop looking back with a smile every time we walked away from the car after 
                            parking it to get something to chew.

                    <p>
                        Finally we arrived and spent a good amount of time with the crew, talking about various options, 
                        based on the budget in hand and how I was planning to use the car, which is what I call opportunitstic 
                        daily driving.
                        The time moved really slow after leaving the car at FatFab. The updates I was getting once in a while 
                        were helping pass it until I could put my hands on the streering wheel again..

                    <p>
                        The craftsmanship and quality of fabrication that goes into the build is very impressive, no wonder
                        the crew earned their name in the market.

                        One of the things that distinguishes these builds is they 
                        don't lower the clearance, although the low turbo mounts. Take a look at the photo below.

                    <p>
                        The car was finally done! It came that this was FatFab's best 800R build in terms of power.
                        I guess being a stronger engine, the 2019 engine was a bit more willing to cooperate with extra
                        air and fuel injection :) Look at the baseline and final dyno charts: the power has almost doubled!

                        With Ruby ready to take on the streets, I was ready to go and check her out to make sure everything was
