                    <h2>What's this site?</h2>
                    <p>Let me first share a bit of context. 
                        After owning a 2010 GT500 for two years I really fell in love with the mustang on steroids.
                        Being hooked on the power, I has reluctant to go with a new Mustang with less ponies under the hood, 
                        despite GT350s that just came out were much better cars in many different ways.
                        After test driving one I could feel how the car was underpowered 
                        (though very capable and just another level compared to the 2010 GT500 I owned).
                        So I started watching for the new GT500.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jan 14th 2019 Ford announced (among other things) that the new GT500 would be automatic, 
                        which was really a dealbreaker for me.
                        That didn't really leave me much of a choice other than going with a boosted GT350.
                        In summer of 2019 I purchased Ruby and the journey began.
